# CuButt
[Buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io) integration to the [Ultracube](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Ultracube) mod for factorio

## Usage
You will need [Intiface Central](https://intiface.com/central/) to be running for the native connector to work.

Download `cubutt-native` from the [Github releases page](https://github.com/ashkitten/factorio-cubutt/releases), then open up a terminal in the directory you downloaded it to, and run it like `./cubutt-native ws://localhost:12345`. If Intiface is running on a different machine such as a phone, replace ws://localhost:12345 with the address shown in Intiface.

Intiface should show that a client called CuButt is connected, and any devices you connect to Intiface should automatically work with the game!

## OS Compatibility
Due to how the mod communicates with the native connector, it is only available for Linux at the moment.
